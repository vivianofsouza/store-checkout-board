# store-checkout-board


# Inspiration

Having worked at a grocery store this summer, one of my primary tasks was directing customers to open checkouts. This app attempts to do just that. Ideally, this info would be shown on a TV screen that all customers can view.

# What it does

This program simulates how a Self Checkout Area would run during three different times of the day: morning (7 AM), lunchtime (12 PM), and evening (6 PM). The program takes in a file in which each line specifies a customer, their payment method (card/cash), their bill amount, and the actual amount they paid. It then prints out a simulation of how each customer would be directed to a machine, along with an update to the "Checkout Board," on which a customer could see which machines are open.

# Improvements
An option to check payment method and direct customers to the right machine will be added. 
A method to calculate change and return it will be added

# Example
